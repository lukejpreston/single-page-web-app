open `index.html` in your browser and do the following changes

1. press `tab` to click the `submit` button, you will need to change the code to make this possible
2. you should be able to click `submit` but there is something in the way because of misuse of `position`
2. add an `alt` to the broken image
3. change the buttons on top to a `nav` and remove css appropriatly
4. change the `span`s to `p`s because they shouldn't look like that
5. change the class names to follow the BEM
5. change the class names to follow the object pattern
6. that table is all wrong, the `.head` should be headers and `.foot` should be foots and there should be a body which is styled instead of `.is-body`
7. put the header in a header, main in a main and footer in a footer and wrap all the sections in the main in sections

**NB** you will notice some of the exercises don't change anything in the view but this exercise is to get you thinking semantics, not to trick you
