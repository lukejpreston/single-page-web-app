# What is bulma?

A pure CSS flexbox library that comes with many components and elements. Responsive and makes your site look really nice and modern. Like bootstrap but without the JavaScript. That means you have to write all the JavaScript code if you want to do things like show a modal or a notification, but you want to do this anyway.

# Installation

`npm i -S bulma`

# Usage

`import 'bulma/css/bumla.css`

Now I will show you a couple of samples. Their documentation is exceptional and you should follow that but I tend to use these things quite frequently.

### Columns, Containers and Sections

### Buttons and Icons

### Hero and Tabs

### Cards and Images

### Menu
