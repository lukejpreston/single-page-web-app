# What is this?

The training is great for learning each thing seperatly. It however lacks 3 important things all developers have to deal with

1. How to actually glue everything together
2. How to update someone else's code who is using these things
3. How to migrate from a rubbish thing to a new thing

We won't cover **3** but will cover the rest

# What is the Counter App

It creates counters which increment/decrement by a certain amount. You can share these counters with other users of the application and they can see/edit them in real time.

# What do I need to do?

You need to implement several features, some are small and some are more complex. But by then end of it you will understand how everything is glued together and also understand how to update someone else's code
