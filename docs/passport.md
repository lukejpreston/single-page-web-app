# What is passport?

Passport is a log in tool. One good thing about passport is that you can also set it up to log in with things like Google or Facebook. This means you don't need to invent user log in for your application and instead let something else handle that

# Usage

# Devices

I would like to see how to do this too! but I know Google will let you do device tokens for things like TVs where typing your username and password can become tedious
