# Single Page Web App

Welcome to the Single Page Web App training

# What is a single page web app?

A single page web app is a website which has a single page. It can also be built into a mobile or desktop application without having to add much (if any) extra code.

The important features:
* responsive
* quick
* clean user interface
* accessible
* secure
* corss-platform
* resilient
* tested
* maintainable
* connected

Thanks to the JavaScript community this is now not as difficult as you would have thought. Something which would have taken teams of developers, testers, and designers over a long period of time can be accomplished by an individual over a much shorter space of time.

If you follow this training from start to finish you will have made a responsive web/mobile/desktop application, you will be able to integrate these applications with social media as well as connect them to other people using the same application.


# The training

You do not need to start from the beginning and work through to the end. Each module is independent of the previous module. The only assumption that model makes is you know everything from the previous modules.

Broken down into

* **Basics**
    * bulma
    * webpack
    * react
    * redux
    * react router
* **Server**
    * koa
    * web sockets
    * passport
    * lokijs
* **Desktop**
    * electron
* **Mobile**
    * react native
* **Testing**
    * jest
    * nightmare

You will also be able to put all your new skills together to create an all inspiring `Counter App`

Each module has 3 parts `About`, `Exercises`, and `Files`

`About` has all the information about the module

`Exercises` are a numbered list of exercies which you can complete using everything int he `About` section

`Files` is a zip of all the files you need to do the course

# What you need to know before starting

You need to know basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Go comeplte the Introduction Exercises

# What is not covered

Anything which costs money: How you get apps into an app store. How to set up a public facing server, e.g. AWS

# Caveats

The training is a starting point only.

It does not compare libraries and techniques. It is 100% biased to what I like with my experience since 2011
