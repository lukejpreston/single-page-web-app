If you did the React module then you will have already used this.

# What is Babel

it is a transformer for code. It will convert your es6 code and your jsx code for you with the following

```
blah
```

# Create React App

All the things I have taught you are great. But someone has already done the hard work before you `create-react-app` will do all the steps up to now.

You can either leave it as it is, config free and feeling great. Or you can run `npm run eject` and then extend the application.

For the rest of these Web Application modules we will be using `create-react-app` and for the Desktop Application and Mobile Application modules we will use it is a starting point or there may be an alternative which is similar that we use but unlikely.
