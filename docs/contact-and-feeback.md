There is no such thing as a bad question, a stupid question, or a random question. You can ask me anything and I will try to respond, assuming it does not violate any of the rules listed above e.g. `Why is React so bad?` will be ignored.

## Disclaimer

As mentioned in the introduction, this is meant to be a starting point and meant to give you more information about where to start looking. Some sections are intentionally incomplete, this is usually followed with where to find more information on the topic but in some cases it is not.

Since this space is constantly changing, and at an alarming rate, the material is subject to change e.g. I am currently updating webpack from 3 to 4. If you find a section is out of date please contact me and I will endevour to update it.

Lastly this is all my personal opinion after working in the space over a couple of years. This reflects more on my approach to coding and does not mean it is the "best" or "correct" way of working. If you disagree with an approach I have taken to solving a problem then by all means contact me as I enjoy a good debate, especially if it is about testing code

Also the site is currently under heavy construction and if you are wondering `why doesn't blah blah work?` message me, but don't be surprised if I say `because I haven't started that section yet`
