# Webpack and CSS compilers

When it comes to processing CSS you have several choices. However it is my opinion that postcss is the best. If you are familiar with sass or less the principles are similar to this

## The plugin

## css next

postcss works with plugins so you may want to monkey around with plugins but there are 2 defacto plugins you will want. The autoprefixer and css next plugin. CSS Next is the latest syntax which many browsers now support. If you bring in the cssnext plugin you do not need to autoprefixer and the principle is the same if you want the autoprexifer one
