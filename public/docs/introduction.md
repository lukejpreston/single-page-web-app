# Single Page Web App

Welcome to the Single Page Web App training

This introduction is to let you know what is in this training material and what you will end up doing should you follow from start to finish

# Training Layout

Each module consists of 3 sections

`About` which gives you information about the subject and typically useful links for more information

`Exercises` run these in order until satisfied

`Files` a zip of files needed for exercises

You do not need to follow from start to finish. Each module is independent of the previous module other than it relies on you having the knowledge from the previous modules e.g. you know what node is and have it installed before you start the es6 module

You need to know basic `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. If you can complete the exercise for the introduction then you will have no problem completing the course

I am using Ubuntu and have been using Macs for a long time. You should be able to do this course on a Windows machine and if you wish to contact me directly you should raise an issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/lukejpreston/single-page-web-app)

# Who are you?

My name is Luke. I attained a degree in Mathematics in 2011. After which I became an IT Consultant for a company called FDM and where I got was a 2 year contract for UBS focusing in Java. After which I went to work at the BBC for 3 years, there I started as a developer working on iPlayer on TV for 2 years, I spent 6 months in R&D and then my last 6 months working on the web, Sport, News, Music primarly. I now work for CEH as an Applications Developer helping Scientists visualise and store data.

I created this course whilst I worked for R&D because I had been writing all my stuff using React. When it came time to do a hand over I realised that few people knew react or es6 so I ran a quick 1 hour course. This turned into a 1 day course which I ran 3 times whilst at the BBC and before I left stated to turn it into somethnig for CS degrees. Unfortunatly I never got the chance to do finish it so instead I have dumped my brain into GitHub.
