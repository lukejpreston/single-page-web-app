# Styling

there are a lot of styling tools for webpack because there are a lot of css compilers.

This module is just to make it so that in your javascript files you can do `import index.css` and it will bundle that css

# Dev Server

since 99% of the time css is not dependant on the state of your app the dev server will just remove the old style and insert the new one and the page will change without refreshing
